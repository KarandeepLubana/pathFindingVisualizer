# Maze And PathFinding Visualizer

## Project Description
An Interactive Visualizer to help understand the process of path finding and maze generation algorithms. This application supports path finding alogrithms
such as Dijkstra, A* and DFS. Random DFS was used for maze generation allowing path finding algortihms to be tested under complex maps.
The application allows the user to place start and end nodes, while also having the ability to create walls on the map.
